  A continuously resilient `xcodebuild` action.
  “The best `xcodebuild` action by far.” ―mxcl
inputs:
  xcode:
    description: |
      A semantic version range, eg. ^10, ~10.3 or 10.3.1
      Leave unset for the image‑default.
    required: false
  swift:
    description: A semantic version range, eg. ^5, ~5.4 or 5.4.1
    required: false
  platform:
    description: |
      Either `iOS`, `tvOS`, `macOS`, `watchOS` or (more rarely)
      `mac-catalyst`
      Leave unset and `xcodebuild` decides itself.
    required: false
  action:
    description: |
      * The most common actions are `test`, `build`.
      * See the `xcodebuild` manual for available actions.
      * Specifying `none` skips the explicit `xcodebuild` step allowing you
        to use this (GitHub) Action solely for selecting an Xcode version.
      * Specifying `''`, `null` or `~` will cause xcodebuild to behave as it
        does without an action specified (usually `build`)
    required: false
    default: test
  code-coverage:
    description: Enables code coverage
    required: false
    default: 'false'
  authentication-key-base64:
    description: |
      A Base64-encoded authentication key issued by App Store Connect. If
      specified, `xcodebuild`` will authenticate with the Apple Developer
      website using this credential. The `authentication-key-id` and
      `authentication-key-issuer-id` parameters are required. Using this key,
      `xcodebuild` will register the GitHub Actions runner device and manage
      code signing certificates for it. Please note that this may cause
      undesired behavior when using GitHub-hosted runners. For best results, use
      App Store Connect API keys only on self-hosted runners.
    required: false
  authentication-key-id:
    description: |
      The key identifier associated with the App Store Conect authentication key
      specified in `authentication-key-base64`. This string can be located in
      the users and access details for your provider at
      "https://appstoreconnect.apple.com". For best results, use App Store
      Connect API keys only on self-hosted runners.
    required: false
  authentication-key-issuer-id:
    description: |
      The App Store Connect issuer identifier associated with the authentication
      key specified in `authentication-key-base64`. This string can be located
      in the users and access details for your provider at
      "https://appstoreconnect.apple.com". For best results, use App Store
      Connect API keys only on self-hosted runners.
    required: false
  code-sign-certificate:
    description: |
      A Base64-encoded certificate to be installed to the macOS Keychain for
      code signing. It is removed from the keychain in the post action. This
      certificate should correspond to the `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` specified in
      your project or to the `code-sign-identity` input. Pass this in as a
      GitHub Encrypted Secret. Requires macOS and
      `code-sign-certificate-passphrase`.
    required: false
  code-sign-certificate-passphrase:
    description: |
      The passphrase used to protect the code signing certificate. Pass this in
      as a GitHub Encrypted Secret.
    required: false
  code-sign-identity:
    description: |
      Identity to be used for code signing. If your project specifies a
      `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY`, this will override it.
    required: false
  mobile-provisioning-profiles-base64:
    description: |
      A multiline list of Base64-encoded mobile provisioning profiles.
    required: false
  provisioning-profiles-base64:
    description: |
      A multiline list of Base64-encoded Mac provisioning profiles.
    required: false
  working-directory:
    description: '…'
    required: false
  configuration:
    description: |
      Typically `Release` or `Debug`.
      Leave unset and `xcodebuild` decides itself.
    required: false
  scheme:
    description: |
      A scheme defined by an Xcode project or workspace.
      If not specified, xcodebuild builds only the first target.
    required: false
  workspace:
    description: |
      We try to detect your workspace, but if we fail you can manually specify
      it with this parameter.
    required: false
  warnings-as-errors:
    description: Fails the build if any warnings in *non test targets*.
    required: false
    default: 'false'
  verbosity:
    description: One of `xcpretty`, `quiet` or `verbose`.
    default: xcpretty
    required: false
  upload-logs:
    description: |
      One of `always` or `on-failure`.
      Consider `always` if you want access to your coverage-reports.
      Beware that artifacts count against your GitHub Actions storage limits.
    default: on-failure
    required: false
  derivedDataPath:
    description: |
      Overrides the folder that should be used for derived data.
    required: false
