  A continuously resilient `xcodebuild` action.
  “The best `xcodebuild` action by far.” ―mxcl
inputs:
  xcode:
    description: |
      A semantic-version, eg. ^10, ~10.3 or 10.3.1
      Leave unset for the image‑default.
    required: false
  swift:
    description: A semantic-version, eg. ^5, ~5.4 or 5.4.1
    required: false
  platform:
    description: |
      Either `iOS`, `tvOS`, `macOS`, `watchOS` or (more rarely)
      `mac-catalyst`
      Leave unset and `xcodebuild` decides itself.
    required: false
  action:
    description: |
      * The most common actions are `test`, `build`.
      * See the `xcodebuild` manual for available actions.
      * Specifying `none` skips the explicit `xcodebuild` step allowing you
        to use this (GitHub) Action solely for selecting an Xcode version.
      * Specifying `''`, `null` or `~` will cause xcodebuild to behave as it
        does without an action specified (usually `build`)
    required: false
    default: test
  code-coverage:
    description: Enables code coverage
    required: false
    default: false
  working-directory:
    description: '…'
    required: false
  configuration:
    description: |
      Typically `Release` or `Debug`.
      Leave unset and `xcodebuild` decides itself.
    required: false
  scheme:
    description: |
      A scheme defined by an Xcode project or workspace.
      If not specified, xcodebuild builds only the first target.
    required: false
  warnings-as-errors:
    description: Fails the build if any warnings in *non test targets*.
    required: false
    default: false
  verbosity:
    description: One of `xcpretty`, `quiet` or `verbose`.
    default: xcpretty
    required: false
  upload-logs:
    description: |
      One of `always` or `on-failure`.
      Consider `always` if you want access to your coverage-reports.
      Beware that artifacts count against your GitHub Actions storage limits.
    default: on-failure
    required: false
runs:
  using: 'node12'
  main: 'dist/index.js'
